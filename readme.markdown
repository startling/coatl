# coatl

coatl is a work-in-progress dependently typed type-checker and
evaluator. One day it will grow up to be a compiler.

The only target executable here is `coatli`, an interactive
interpreter. It's usable now! There are three built-ins --
`Type`, the type of Types, `(->)`, a constructor of function
types, and `(~)`, which is used to represent the dependent
function space.

We can use `(~)` to represent `the` easily:

````coatl
the : Type ~ { a => a -> a };
the _ a = a;
````

Functions with multiple dependent parameters, though, become
unwieldy:

````coatl
const : Type ~ { a => Type ~ { b => a -> b -> a } };
const _ _ a _ = a;
````

An improvement to this situation is planned.
